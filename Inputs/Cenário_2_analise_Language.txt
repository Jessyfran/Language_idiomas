Maguari store
16/7/2024
In July I bought a cooktop stove counter through the store's website. 
It arrived on 16/07, with damage and I complained on the same day. To date, I have not had a solution to my purchase problem. 
They said they had a 30 day deadline, which has already passed and they didn't resolve it, I feel deceived by the store.
