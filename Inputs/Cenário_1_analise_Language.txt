Airport Avens
 The Airport Avens, London, UK
 9/9/2024
 The airport has a very good discount program, affordable plans and packages, good service and a great location. However, the food area is bad, as it doesn't have many options and doesn't cover all times. 
The waiting rooms are crowded and a little uncomfortable and some bathrooms do not have changing tables for children, which also makes it uncomfortable to find one closer to boarding.
